sakra - swiss army knife rss aggregator

SYNOPSIS:
  sakra [-c] [FEEDGROUP]...

DEPENDENCIES:
  curl, sfeed

-----
WHY?
-----

I use RSS for watching YouTube, listening to podcasts, and keeping up on blogs.
I could never find a single program that would handle all three of these needs
for me so I wrote one myself.
If you are someone struggling with the same issue, or someone who just wants a
simple CLI RSS aggregator, I hope sakra can fill your needs well. If it can't,
let me know why by opening an issue or by contacting me in some other fashion.

-----------
QUICKSTART
-----------

1. Make a file named ~/.sakra/<feedgroup>.feeds (where <feedgroup> is some
   arbitrary name, i.e. "podcasts") and populate it with a newline-separated
   list of URLs to fetch RSS feeds from. This defines a new "feedgroup" for
   sakra to keep track of.
2. Assuming you don't want to download the entire back catalog of everything in
   the feedgroup, run the "sakra -c <feedgroup>" command (replace <feedgroup>
   with the name of the feedgroup you defined on step #1) to tell sakra to
   "catch up" on your feedgroup.
3. In the future when you want to update your feeds (i.e. download podcasts or
   whatever), run the "sakra" command and it will download each new item
   (defaults to downloading the enclosure, falls back to downloading the link)
   into $HOME/<feedgroup>/ (directory created automatically).

Simple enough. You can use that quickstart guide to download both podcasts and
web pages. But that's just using the default behavior, sakra is much more
versatile than that, as you will see in the RC SCRIPTS section.

-----------
RC SCRIPTS
-----------

The handling of each item in each feed of a feedgroup may be overridden by the
user. This is done via an "rc" script. An rc script is a simple executable
(therefore language agnostic) which will be called each time a new feed item
is processed. Information about the feed item is passed to the rc script via
environment variables.

The following environment variables are passed:
  TIMESTAMP
  TITLE
  LINK
  CONTENT
  CONTENT_TYPE
  GUID
  AUTHOR
  ENCLOSURE
  FEEDGROUP

All of these environment variables (with the exception of the FEEDGROUP, which
is just a convenient way of getting the name of the feedgroup) correspond to
attributes of the feed item (and therefore may be empty). The stdout, stderr,
stdin of the script are currently unused. If the script exits with an error
then sakra will skip the failed feed item and try to re-run the rc script on
the failed feed item the next time sakra is invoked.

Example rc scripts can be found in the "examplerc" directory of this
repository.

--------------------
OTHER CONFIGURATION
--------------------

The SAKRADIR environment variable may be used to change the default location of
sakra's configuration directory, usually ~/.sakra
