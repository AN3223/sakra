sakra2 - swiss army knife rss aggregator

SYNOPSIS:
  sakra2 [-cv] [FEEDGROUP[/FEEDID]]...

DEPENDENCIES:
  sfeed, curl

-----
WHY?
-----

I use RSS for watching YouTube, listening to podcasts, and keeping up on blogs.
I could never find a single program that would handle all three of these needs
for me so I wrote one myself.

If you are someone struggling with the same issue, or someone who just wants a
simple RSS aggregator, I hope that you would find sakra2 useful.

-----------
QUICKSTART
-----------

1. Place feed URLs in ~/.sakra2/<feedgroup>.feeds (<feedgroup> is an arbitrary
	 name, e.g., "podcasts"). One URL per line, with an optional feed ID after
	 the URL, separated by a space.

2. Run "sakra2 -c <feedgroup>" to "catch up" on the new feed group, skipping
	 all of the items currently on the feeds. Skip this step if you want to
	 download the back catalogs of the new feeds.

3. Later run "sakra2" to update your feeds. It will download each new item
	 (enclosure if available, falling back to curling the link) into
	 $HOME/<feedgroup>/ (directory created automatically).

4. Later when you want to append a new feed to your feed group:
	 echo "<feedurl> <feedID>" >> ~/.sakra2/<feedgroup>.feeds
	 sakra2 -c <feedgroup>/<feedID>  # again, assuming no back catalog

This process should work for both podcasts and web pages (news, blogs, etc.).

For downloading YouTube videos, place feed URLs[0] in ~/.sakra2/youtube.feeds
and link the youtuberc script into your sakra2 directory:

$ ln -s $SAKRAREPO/examplerc/youtuberc ~/.sakra2/youtuberc

For saving YouTube links as m3u files, which can hopefully be handled by a
YouTube-aware media player, e.g., mpv+youtube-dl, do the same process with the
youtube-m3urc script:

$ ln -s $SAKRAREPO/examplerc/youtube-m3urc ~/.sakra2/youtube-m3urc

There's also a news-contentrc for speeding up fetches from sites that cram
whole posts into the RSS <description> tag.

[0] The y2rss script can do YouTube URLs -> RSS URLs conversion:

$ y2rss https://youtube.com/user/tuxreviews/videos
-> https://youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?user=tuxreviews

y2rss is a perl script which requires the Perl URI module. It may be installed
already, otherwise you should search for the package and install it.

If the channel name has ever changed, you'll need to make sure the original
name is used for generating the RSS link so you don't get a 404. The default
landing page for a YouTube channel will usually work, but if you click links on
that page it may update the URL to the new channel name, which won't work with
any RSS reader.

Does this seem complex? It's not my fault. Blame Google.

-----------
RC SCRIPTS
-----------

The handling of each item in each feed of a feedgroup may be overridden by the
user. This is done via an rc script. An rc script is simply an executable which
will be called each time a new feed item is processed. Information about the
feed item is passed to the rc script via environment variables.

The following environment variables are passed to rc scripts:
  TIMESTAMP
  TITLE
  LINK
  CONTENT
  CONTENT_TYPE
  GUID
  AUTHOR
  ENCLOSURE
  FEEDGROUP
  FEEDNAME
  SAKRAHOME
  NV
  V
  VV
  VVV

Most of these environment variables come straight from the feed item and may be
empty.

If the rc script exits with an error then sakra2 will skip the failed feed item
and try to re-run the rc script on the failed feed item the next time sakra2 is
invoked. This is usually useful for network errors or other transient errors.

SAKRAHOME is the parent directory of where the user would prefer their downloads
to be dropped into (e.g., $SAKRAHOME/news for news).

FEEDNAME is the optional name of the feed added by the user after the URL in the
feeds file.

The V environment variable is the verbosity level set by occurrences of the -v
flag. The VV, VVV, and NV variables are based on the value of V, they're meant
convenience in parameter expansions (e.g., curl ${VVV:+-v} ...). NV corresponds
to no -v flags, V corresponds to 1 or more, VV corresponds to 2 or more, VVV
corresponds to 3 or more.

Example rc scripts can be found in the "examplerc" directory of this
repository.

--------------------
OTHER CONFIGURATION
--------------------

After each URL an optional FEEDNAME/FEEDID may be included, which will override
the AUTHOR in the filename if the rc script supports it and makes it easy to
update/catch up on a single feed (otherwise a FEEDID is generated from the
URL).

The SAKRADIR environment variable may be used to change the default location of
sakra2's configuration directory, usually ~/.sakra2

The SAKRAHOME environment variable may be used to ask sakra2 (and sakra2's rc
scripts) to drop your downloads into an alternative parent directory, instead of
your HOME.
